Hello Github, this is an assigment to check if I can succesfully upload a dataset to github. The dataset I will be uploading is called truthful_qa. 'original' was quoted as the Dataset source and the readmd is written by lhoestq on Huggingface. This dataset was made to test if a language model can answer truthfully to misconceptions that humans would sometimes mistakenly answer incorrectly. Therefore, the variables include the type; divided into whether the question was produced by an 'adversarial' procedure or not in the case of 'non-adversarial'. A category showing wether the misconception is one about health, law, etc.The misconception in the form of a question. Other variables include the best answer, other correct answers and incorrect answers. The final variable is the source of the question contents.
